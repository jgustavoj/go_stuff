# go_stuff

Some commands to remember

```go
// usually you want to use the repository path example: github.com/username/repo
$ go mod init example/hello

// Create you .go file where you code will live

// Add new module requirements and sums. Go will add the quote module as a requirement, as well as a go.sum file for use in authenticating the module. 
$ go mod tidy

```
